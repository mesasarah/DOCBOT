## Abstract

In today's knowledge-driven world, accessing and processing information is crucial for decision-making and productivity. However, reliance on internet connectivity often hinders access to vital information stored in documents. DOCBOT, an offline chatbot powered by machine learning and Langchain technology, addresses this challenge by providing an intelligent document assistant that seamlessly extracts and summarizes information from uploaded PDF documents without the need for an internet connection.

DOCBOT's core functionality revolves around its ability to process and interpret PDF documents. Upon uploading a PDF, DOCBOT employs advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract key information and identify relevant concepts. This extracted information is then utilized to generate comprehensive and informative responses to user queries, even in the absence of an internet connection.

DOCBOT's offline capabilities make it an invaluable tool for organizations and individuals operating in environments with limited or no internet access. Its ability to extract information and respond to queries from PDF documents makes it a versatile solution for tasks such as document summarization, question answering, and knowledge extraction.

## Introduction

DOCBOT is an offline document assistant that uses artificial intelligence to help you understand your documents. DOCBOT can read and understand any type of document, including PDFs, Word documents, and many more. It can then answer your questions about the document in a clear and concise way.

### 1.1 Problem Definition

In today's increasingly interconnected world, we rely on internet access for a wide range of activities, including communication, work, and entertainment. However, there are still many situations where internet access is unavailable or unreliable. In these cases, offline chatbots can provide a valuable alternative to traditional online chatbots.

Specific Challenges:

- Internet Dependence: Traditional online chatbots rely on an internet connection to function. This can be a major limitation in areas with poor or no internet infrastructure.
- Privacy Concerns: Online chatbots often collect and store personal data from users, which raises privacy concerns. Offline chatbots can minimize these concerns by operating locally on the user's device.
- Accessibility: Offline chatbots can be accessed by users with disabilities or those who lack access to traditional communication channels.

### 1.2 Solution Approach

The high-level architecture of the implementation can be seen as shown below:

The solution to the problem is divided into several key steps:

1. Data preparation: The first step is to prepare the data that will be used to train the embedding model. This data can be text, code, or other types of data.
2. Embedding model training: The next step is to train the embedding model. The embedding model is used to transform the data into a format that can be understood by the LLM model.
3. Vector database creation: The next step is to create a vector database. The vector database stores the vectors that are produced by the embedding model.
4. LLM model selection: The next step is to select an LLM model. The LLM model is used to perform tasks such as text generation, translation, and question answering.
5. Application development: The next step is to develop the application. The application uses the embedding model, vector database, and LLM model to perform its tasks.
6. Deployment: The final step is to deploy the application. The application can be deployed to a cloud platform or on-premises.

### 1.3 Technologies Used

In the implementation of this project, various technologies have been employed, each chosen for specific reasons:

#### Embedding Model

The embedding model, miniLM L6 V2, is responsible for transforming text input into a numerical representation that can be understood by the LLM model. This process involves breaking down the text into smaller units, such as words or phrases, and then mapping each unit to a unique vector of numbers. The vector representation captures the semantic meaning of the text input and allows the LLM model to process it effectively.

#### Vector Database

The vector database, Chroma, stores the vector representations of various text inputs. This database serves as a repository of knowledge for the LLM model, allowing it to access and utilize previously processed information. The use of a vector database improves the efficiency and performance of the system, as the LLM model doesn't need to reprocess the same text input each time.

#### LLM Model

The LLM model, Llama, is the core component of the LangChain process. It is responsible for generating text, translating languages, writing different creative content, and answering your questions in an informative way. The LLM model receives the vector representations from the embedding model and processes them using its internal neural network architecture. This process allows the LLM model to generate text that is relevant, coherent, and consistent with the input information.

#### User Interface

The user interface, Streamlit, provides a platform for interacting with the LangChain system. It allows users to input text, receive responses from the LLM model, and visualize the results. Streamlit's interactive nature enables users to explore the capabilities of the LLM model and gain insights from its generated text.

These technologies have been carefully selected to leverage their strengths and capabilities, resulting in a robust and efficient implementation of the project.
